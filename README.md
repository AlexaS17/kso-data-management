# koster_Zooniverse
This repository contains scripts realted to the citizen science and database modules of the koster seafloor observatory, a system to manage, process, and analyse large amounts of subsea movie data for marine ecological research.

The aim of the koster seafloor observatory is to combine citizen scientists classifications and machine learning algorithms to automatically identify marine species from ROV underwater footage.
